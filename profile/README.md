## Projects

### 1. [AI Table Tennis Coach](https://github.com/Infera-Cognix-Labs/AI-Tabel-Tennis-Coach)
A smart system designed to help table tennis players monitor their technique, evaluate performance, and improve their ball striking ability through AI and motion sensors. The system uses computer vision, motion analysis, and IMU sensors for real-time feedback.

#### Key Features:
- AI-based pose recognition for analyzing key table tennis actions (e.g., serve, forehand loop, chop).
- Real-time movement analysis and footwork optimization.
- Integration with IMU sensors for racket swing speed, impact force, and spin prediction.
- Real-time video overlay and dashboard for performance tracking.

### 2. [IoT-based Water Quality Monitoring](https://github.com/Infera-Cognix-Labs/Water-Quality-Monitoring)
A project designed to monitor the water quality using a network of sensors (pH, TDS, temperature) and provide real-time analytics through a cloud dashboard.

#### Key Features:
- Real-time data collection from various water quality sensors.
- Cloud integration for storing and visualizing water quality data.
- Alert system for detecting unsafe water conditions.

### 3. [Sign Language Recognition System](https://github.com/Infera-Cognix-Labs/Sign-Language-Recognition)
A system that uses deep learning and computer vision to recognize and translate sign language into text or speech in real time.

#### Key Features:
- Uses YOLO and deep learning models for sign language gesture detection.
- Real-time translation of sign language into text or voice.
- A mobile app interface for users to interact with the system.

### 4. [Smart Greenhouse Management System](https://github.com/Infera-Cognix-Labs/Smart-Greenhouse-Management)
An IoT-powered greenhouse management system that monitors environmental factors such as humidity, temperature, soil moisture, and light to optimize plant growth.

#### Key Features:
- Data collection from environmental sensors (humidity, temperature, moisture).
- Automated control of irrigation and ventilation systems based on sensor data.
- Cloud-based dashboard for real-time monitoring and control.
