## Projects

### 1. [AI Table Tennis Coach](https://github.com/Infera-Cognix-Labs/AI-Tabel-Tennis-Coach)
A smart system designed to help table tennis players monitor their technique, evaluate performance, and improve their ball striking ability through AI and motion sensors. The system uses computer vision, motion analysis, and IMU sensors for real-time feedback.

#### Key Features:
- AI-based pose recognition for analyzing key table tennis actions (e.g., serve, forehand loop, chop).
- Real-time movement analysis and footwork optimization.
- Integration with IMU sensors for racket swing speed, impact force, and spin prediction.
- Real-time video overlay and dashboard for performance tracking.
